# qtnanosvg
These are some utilities ported over from the [CairoWidget](https://github.com/user1095108/cairowidget) project. Qt's own SVG rendering is notoriously slow and buggy, it can even crash your program. [NanoSVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanosvg) is an easy and reliable alternative, though it is also buggy. Using SVG and vector graphics in general in your project solves the problem of resolution-independent resources.
