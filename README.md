# qtnanosvg
These are some utilities ported over from the [CairoWidget](https://github.com/user1095108/cairowidget) project. Qt's own SVG rendering is notoriously slow and buggy, it can even crash your program. NanoSVG is an easy and reliable alternative, though it is also buggy. Using SVG in your project solves the problem of resolution-independent resources in your GUI application.
